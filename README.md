# Banana Detection using Image-Based Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a system that can detect whether a fruit is chemically ripened or naturally grown using image-based machine learning techniques. The overall project is divided into three phases, focusing on progressive improvements and model accuracy.
Phase 1 (Current Phase):
The initial phase focuses on fruit detection, using bananas as the test fruit. The model detects whether a given image contains a banana or not. This forms the foundation for the next phases where ripening type detection will be implemented.
Future Phases:
Phase 2: Detect whether the banana is chemically ripened or naturally grown.
Phase 3: Extend the system to other fruits and improve model accuracy and deployment features.

### Key Objectives of Phase 1:
Build a reliable fruit detection model.
Preprocess images and handle real-time predictions.
Establish a workflow and framework for future phases.
Current Results:
The model currently detects whether an image contains a banana with 92% accuracy.
This phase lays the groundwork for detecting chemical ripening in the next phases.
