# Banana Detection using Image-Based Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting whether a given fruit image is a banana or not using machine learning techniques. 
Currently, the model achieves **92% accuracy** in identifying bananas from a set of fruit images. This is a step toward building AI-based fruit classification systems for food safety and quality assessment.

## Key Features
- Binary classification: Banana vs Non-Banana
- Image preprocessing for improved model performance
- Model evaluation to measure accuracy

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning libraries: scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- Image processing: OpenCV / PIL  
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhinaya281/Detection-of-chemically-ripened-fruits-using-Image-based-machine-learning-.git
