# Detection-of-chemically-ripened-fruits-using-Image-based-machine-learning-
This project focuses on detecting whether a given fruit image is a banana or not using machine learning techniques. Currently, the model achieves 92% accuracy in identifying bananas from a set of fruit images. This is a step toward building AI-based fruit classification systems for food safety and quality assessment.
